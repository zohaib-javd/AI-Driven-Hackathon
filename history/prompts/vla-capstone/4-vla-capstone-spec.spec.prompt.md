  Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

  Target audience:
  - Students learning how LLMs and perception models interface with robotics
  - Developers building natural-language-driven robotic behaviors
  - Learners preparing for full autonomous humanoid agents

  Focus:
  - The convergence of LLMs, computer vision, and robotics control
  - OpenAI Whisper for voice command recognition
  - Cognitive planning: mapping natural language to ROS 2 actions
  - Integration of perception, navigation, and manipulation into a single pipeline
  - Capstone: Autonomous humanoid capable of "Voice → Plan → Navigate → Perceive → Act"

  Success criteria:
  - Student can process voice input using Whisper and convert it into structured commands
  - Student can build a reasoning pipeline where an LLM outputs ROS 2 action sequences
  - Student integrates perception (object detection), navigation (Nav2), and manipulation into one loop
  - Final capstone demo completes a full autonomous task given only a spoken command
  - All components work inside simulation environments (Isaac Sim or Gazebo)

  Constraints:
  - Output format: Docusaurus MDX chapters
  - Each chapter: 800–1500 words, code blocks, diagrams (text-described), and step pipelines
  - All LLM examples must use model-agnostic prompts (OpenAI, Claude, or LLaMA compatible)
  - No vendor-specific lock-in; planning logic must be portable
  - No hardware deployment (simulation-only)
  - No deep dives into Isaac internals (covered in Module 3)

  Chapter Outline:
  1. Introduction: What is Vision-Language-Action?
  2. Understanding the VLA Pipeline: Voice → Language → Reasoning → Action
  3. OpenAI Whisper Overview + Voice-to-Text Setup
  4. Parsing Natural Language Commands into Structured Robot Tasks
  5. LLM-Based Cognitive Planning (Task Breakdown + ROS 2 Actions)
  6. Safety Constraints & Guardrails for LLM-Controlled Robots
  7. Integrating Perception Models (Object Detection, Segmentation)
  8. Connecting Perception to Action: Picking Target Objects
  9. Navigation Integration: Using Nav2 with LLM-Generated Plans
  10. Manipulation: Grasping, Aligning, and Executing Pick-and-Place Tasks
  11. Building the Complete VLA Agent Loop
  12. Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid
      - Voice command input
      - Planning the sequence
      - Navigating obstacles
      - Detecting and selecting objects
      - Performing manipulation actions
  13. Testing, Metrics, and Failure Analysis
  14. Module Summary + MCQs + Practical Challenges

  Not building:
  - Low-level ROS 2 fundamentals (Module 1 covers this)
  - Simulation pipelines (Module 2 & 3)
  - Hardware deployments or real robot control
  - Reinforcement learning or policy-gradient training

  Timeline:
  - Module 4 is the final stage and must follow completion of Modules 1–3
